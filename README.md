# reciPY

reciPy pulls data from mealDB's API using requests and formats it internally as a json. The user gives an input, and recipes within the database that share a similar name are displayed. The user may then pick from a recipe, which displays instructions and ingredients on the right.

reciPy is a graphical user-interface implementation of the mealDataBase.
